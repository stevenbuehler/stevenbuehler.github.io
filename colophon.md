# Colophon

<div align="center"><img src="/images/colophon.png" /></div>

A _colophon_ is "a statement at the end of a book, typically with a printer's emblem, giving information about its authorship and printing" (Oxford Languages).  I've seen a few of these on blog sites explaining how the site runs and also a few personal ones detailing the tools that bloggers and other geeky folk use in their everyday lives.  I've modeled mine over the last few years after [Jon Saddington](https://john.do/colophon)'s, because it provides for me a good model to follow. It also satiates my curiosity. üòÅ

The most significant update in this version is that I'm back to using [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/iphone) as my primary platforms. I haven't _totally_ forsaken Windows (because Macs are not exactly known for great gaming experiences), but gaming (and work, by necessity) are about the only purposes I use it for anymore.

## My Most Important Tools

My two most important tools are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [emacs](https://www.emacs.org) [org-mode](https://orgmode.org). VS Code is a cross-platform text and code editor adaptable to just about every situation; `org-mode` keeps me organized, lets me track my work, and lets me easily keep records of other things with simple, portable plain text files. I write the pages and posts for my blog in Markdown using VS Code.

## Web Tools

The blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.io), powered by the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog engine. Pages and posts can be written using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (my personal preference), X/HTML, or [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) markup. The theme is more or less stock, with a few customizations to suit my own tastes and format needs.

I've been working to consolidate all of my email, documents, records, &c., into a single place ([iCloud](https://www.icloud.com), as that's the most convenient when working on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad), but I also use [Microsoft 365](https://www.office365.com) and [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com) ~~rather frequently~~ on occasion as the need arises, especially Google Apps Script and [PowerShell Core](https://powershell.org) on my Mac and Raspberry Pi for automating a lot of things and creating "front ends" to various APIs that I work with on a regular basis, because I can set hourly triggers to keep the API tokens up to date.

[Feedly](https://www.feedly.com) in combination with [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) keeps me up-to-speed with RSS/Atom feed reading.

I engage in social media on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stevenwatsonbuehler), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gloriousabsence), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/gloriousabsenceofskill), and [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@gloriousabsenceofskill), and frequently livestream on Facebook and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gloriousabsenceofskill). In 2021 I added Snapchat back (as GloriousAbsence, since it's limited to 15 characters). I also post a lot of video content (archived game streams, mostly) to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmugswFkJX7kFvuyqEYA9LA).

I've started using Nvidia's [GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) for gaming on my Mac.

## Software Tools

Rather than write with a word processor like Word or Pages, I do most of my writing using Dr. [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/)'s [TeX](https://www.tug.org) computer typesetting package, Markdown, or `org-mode`. Plain text files are much more portable and I don't have to worry a whole lot about them becoming incompatible with later software versions down the road; and when I need to send something in a proprietary format like Word or an ebook, [Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org) comes to the rescue.

There are somethings that TeX can't do without significant effort, though; and in those cases where something fancier is needed I'll use ~~[Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com) or~~ Apple's "formerly known as iWork" suite ([Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/), [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers), [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote)). 

## Analog/Hardware Tools

I had previously written that nothing will ever replace pencil/pen and paper, but I've come to change that view now that technology has advanced enough where handwriting and speech recognition are practically seamless.

That's not to say that I have _completely_ eliminated pen/pencil and paper from my life. As I get older, and also being old school, there are times when I want to leaf through the pages of a dead tree versus swiping across a screen.

For pen and paper, I've found Norcom's [Exceed](http://www.norcominc.com/brands/products.php?brand=2) products to be every bit as good in quality as the [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/)s, [Leuchtturm](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebooks/)s, and [Rhodia](https://rhodiapads.com/)s of the world, for a lot less money, and they are much more readily available (as in you can buy them at the local Walmart). My preferred pens are PaperMate's [Ink Joy](https://inkjoy.papermate.com/en-US/pens) gel pens; but given that they oftentimes bleed through paper I tend to use Zebra a lot more (their [F-301](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-301-ball-point-retractable/) ballpoint pens and [M-301](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/m-301-mechanical-pencil/) mechanical pencils are a pleasure to write with). While I try to keep separate notebooks or journals for personal versus work-related notes, it rarely ends up that way. Ultimately, _everything_ that is on paper is digitally captured, scanned, snapshotted, and OCRd into my digital tools. 

My **desktop** consists of:

- [iBuyPower Slate 9000W Gaming PC](https://www.walmart.com/ip/iBUYPOWER-Gaming-Desktop-PC-SLATE9000W-Intel-Core-i7-9700F-16GB-DDR4-2666Memory-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660Ti-240GB-SSD-1TB-HDD-RGB-Windows-10-Home-64-Bi/436132832) (i7-9700K, 16 GB RAM, 240 GB SSD and 2 TB HDD).
