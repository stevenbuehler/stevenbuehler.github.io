# Now

â€¦is a concept I discovered via a site named [nownownow](https://nownownow.com). Simply a description of what's going on around me at the moment. Last updated on **April 29, 2021**.

## Life in General

Last Friday I hit the milestone of 49 years surviving on this planet. My folks' birthday card arrived exactly on the day. I've not seen the rest of my family in several years as I am on my own down here in Florida and they are all up north (Michigan and New York). My folks came down to the Florida panhandle to snowbird for a couple of months but we decided because of COVID that making the trip would not be a good idea, so I missed them this year.

The next med check for my Aspergers is on May 7th. 

## Theme Parks

[Universal](https://universalorlando.com) is opening the new [Jurassic World VelociCoaster](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/jurassic-world-velocicoaster) officially on June 10th, but I scored a passholder preview ride time on the evening of May 2nd. Two launches, four inversions, and just a lap bar holding you in. Looks like they will be implementing the same "no loose articles" rules as they have with [Hulk](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/the-incredible-hulk-coaster) and [Rip Ride RockIt&trade;](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/hollywood-rip-ride-rockit), with metal detectors to enforce the rules. 

I've only been to [SeaWorld](https://seaworld.com/orlando) once in the last few months and to [Busch Gardens](http://buschgardens.com/tampa) even less. I bought a Quick Queue ticket for SeaWorld a couple of weekends ago and ended up not needing it because the lines were still very short in the morning. 

I don't even bother talking about [Disney World](https://www.waltdisneyworld.com) anymore. There's been no mention of whether they plan to resume Annual Pass sales and it's been all but formally announced that the reservation system is there to stay. 

## Work

I recently finished one major project in time to start finishing another. It's not glorious but it pays the bills. I work 100% from home now and I am *loving* it. 

## Mood

On the downside, being cooped up in the apartment all the time and rarely getting outside makes me far more tired than usual, and I'm probably getting way too much sleep outside of my working hours. Gaming helps to an extent, but even that gets boring after a while. In the past (pre-COVID) I would've hit a theme park one night _during_ the week to break the monotony, but theme parks are operating on bankers' hours during the week and I no longer have a pass for Disney.
